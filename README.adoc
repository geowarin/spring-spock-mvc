# Spring-spock-mvc

A thin layer over spring-test-mvc to make tests more spock-friendly

# Motivation

Spring mvc tests are great but with their fluent looks, they are not a naturally
fit with spock.

This is why I created a very small layer to make it look nicer in groovy, using
the capabilities of the language like JSON parsing.

# Setup

My recommendation is to create a base class for your specifications

```groovy

@ContextConfiguration(
  loader = SpringApplicationContextLoader,
  classes = [MyApplication]
)
abstract class AbstractMvcSpec extends SpockMvcSpec {

  @Override
  MockMvc buildMockMvc(WebApplicationContext wac) {
    MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(wac).build()
  }
}
```

# Usage


```groovy
class AuthenticationSpec extends AbstractMvcSpec {

  def "unauthenticated users cannot get resource"() {
    when:
    def res = get('/api/simple')

    then:
    res.status == HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN
  }

  def "get session"() {
    when:
    def res = get('/api/session', new RequestParams(authToken: 'secretToken'))

    then:
    res.status == HttpStatus.OK
    res.json.username == 'user'
  }
}
```

## Availability

This package is hosted on https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter[jcenter]

It is therefore available directly from a groovy grape.

You can also include the `jcenter()` repository in your gradle script.

Or add a bunch of XML in your pom.xml.
